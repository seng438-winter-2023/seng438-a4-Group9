# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites
An initial run of mutatiom testing indicated a score of 56%. To increase, the code we increased the code coverage. Additionally, To improve the mutation score, it is crucial to use diverse test data that can explore different execution paths and uncover hidden faults.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing
## Advantages of mutation testing
- Thoroughness
- Quality assurance
- Improves test coverage
- Helps in debugging

## Disadvantages of mutation testing
- Computational complexity
- Requires expertise
- False positives
- Difficult to automate
# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix
## Advantages of Selenium
- Supports a variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, C#, and JavaScript.
- Supports multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.
- Provides a wide range of testing capabilities, including UI testing, functional testing, and regression testing.
- Supports distributed testing, which enables parallel execution of tests across multiple machines.
- Has a large and active community, which provides support and contributes to the development of the tool.

## Disadvantages of Selenium
- Requires expertise in programming and testing, which can make it difficult for non-technical team members to use.
- Can be time-consuming to set up and configure, especially for complex applications.
- Can be prone to flakiness due to timing issues and synchronization problems.
- Limited support for testing desktop applications and mobile apps.

## Advantages of SikuliX
- Provides a visual testing approach, which makes it easy to use for non-technical team members.
- Supports testing of desktop applications and web applications.
- Has built-in image recognition capabilities, which enables it to interact with applications regardless of the underlying technology used.
- Supports multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
- Has a scripting interface that supports multiple programming languages.

## Disadvantages of SikuliX
- Can be slower compared to other testing tools due to its image recognition capabilities.
- Can be less reliable than other testing tools due to the potential for false positives and false negatives.
- Limited support for testing mobile apps.
- Smaller community compared to Selenium, which can make it more challenging to find support and resources.
