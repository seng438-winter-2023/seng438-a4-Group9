# Introduction


# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites
An initial run of mutatiom testing indicated a score of 56%. To increase, the code we increased the code coverage. Additionally, To improve the mutation score, it is crucial to use diverse test data that can explore different execution paths and uncover hidden faults.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing
## Advantages of mutation testing
- Thoroughness
- Quality assurance
- Improves test coverage
- Helps in debugging

## Disadvantages of mutation testing
- Computational complexity
- Requires expertise
- False positives
- Difficult to automate

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process
Login - Valid : The functionality of this test case is to login to your amazon account with a valid username and password. First the sign in page is prompted and you enter the username and press continue button. After that you are directed to the password field where you enter the correct password and once you press submit it should sign into your account.
Login - Invalid Username : The functionality of this test case is to login to your amazon account but with an invalid username and a valid password. First the sign in page is prompted and you enter the invalid username and press continue button. It will provide you an error message mentioning that no such account exist and once you enter the correct username it will direct you to the password field where you enter the correct password and once you press submit it should sign into your account.
Login - Invalid Password : The functionality of this test case is to login to your amazon account with a valid username but with an invalid password. First the sign in page is prompted and you enter the username and press continue button. After that you are directed to the password field where you enter the invalid password and it will show you that it is the wrong password. And when you enter the correct password in the correct time, and you press submit it should sign into your account.
Add new address : The functionality of this test case is to add a new address to your signed in account. Once you are signed in and when you go to the add new address page, it as to enter street number, name, city, postal code and the country. After valid input of data, it will add the new address to your account.
Sign out : The functionality of this test case is to sign out from your signed in account. When you press the sign out button in the main page, it will automatically sign you out of the account.
Search Bar : The functionality of this test case is to search an item in the search bar. When you go to the search bar and press search icon, you should be able to see the list of products that belongs to the searching name that you gave.
Change Language : The functionality of this test case is to change the language of the operating page. According to the location we are in, Canada, we have between two languages to pick, select English or French where I changed to both languages after each other.
Sort price from high to low : The functionality of this test case is to sort the product list from price high to low. When you go to the sorting options, you can check the sort by price high to low options.

# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix
## Advantages of Selenium
- Supports a variety of programming languages, including Java, Python, C#, and JavaScript.
- Supports multiple browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.
- Provides a wide range of testing capabilities, including UI testing, functional testing, and regression testing.
- Supports distributed testing, which enables parallel execution of tests across multiple machines.
- Has a large and active community, which provides support and contributes to the development of the tool.

## Disadvantages of Selenium
- Requires expertise in programming and testing, which can make it difficult for non-technical team members to use.
- Can be time-consuming to set up and configure, especially for complex applications.
- Can be prone to flakiness due to timing issues and synchronization problems.
- Limited support for testing desktop applications and mobile apps.

## Advantages of SikuliX
- Provides a visual testing approach, which makes it easy to use for non-technical team members.
- Supports testing of desktop applications and web applications.
- Has built-in image recognition capabilities, which enables it to interact with applications regardless of the underlying technology used.
- Supports multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OS.
- Has a scripting interface that supports multiple programming languages.

## Disadvantages of SikuliX
- Can be slower compared to other testing tools due to its image recognition capabilities.
- Can be less reliable than other testing tools due to the potential for false positives and false negatives.
- Limited support for testing mobile apps.
- Smaller community compared to Selenium, which can make it more challenging to find support and resources.
# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
The workload was divided equally amongst the 4 members. Thevin and Noureldin worked together to increase the mutation testing for the datautilities 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
A few challenges were encountered in this project. One major difficulty was coordinating our schedules. To solve this issue, we made a plan to hold regular checkups throught the two week period of the assignment, along with one in-person meeting to divide the work. We also faced some technical difficulties with the testing framework, which required us to spend some extra time researching and finding solutions.
# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
Overall, getting mutation testing through PIT in eclipce was a struggle, and took us the majority of the lab duration to get PIT to work. However, GUI testing was an easier task, and provided ensight into real a new type of testing.
